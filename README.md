Based on the results the Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm has the highest accuracy and precision scores among all the algorithms evaluated for detecting whether a message is spam or not.

Accuracy: NB achieved an accuracy of 0.97, which means it correctly classified approximately 97.29% of the messages as either spam or not spam. This high accuracy suggests that NB is effective in distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages.

Precision: NB obtained a precision score of 1.000, indicating that when it predicted a message as spam, it was correct 100% of the time. In other words, NB has a very low false positive rate, meaning it rarely misclassifies non-spam messages as spam.

Considering these results, NB stands out as a strong choice for spam detection. It offers a high overall accuracy and an impressive precision score, ensuring that when it predicts a message as spam, it is highly likely to be correct.

We are going to use Naive Bayes model as our final model for prediction
